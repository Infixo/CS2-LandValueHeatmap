# [DEPRECATED] Land Value Heatmap

**DO NOT USE**. Due to Land Value overhaul introduced in v1.1 of the game, this mod is no longer valid.

Makes Land Value heatmap more informative.
 - Land and Buildings use the same color scale so it is easy to spot differences that would influence LV i.e. buildings darker than land will drive your LV up.
 - Increased range of values so the heatmap does not saturate easy in bigger cities, where you usually end up with green buildings and blue land everywhere.

## Scaling
- Vanilla version is scaled for LV up to 500 and it includes 10 gradients.
- Modded version is scaled up to 2500 and it includes 25 gradients, so 1 gradient is approx. 100 LV.
